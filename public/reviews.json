Biggest bug I've found is with the rating system! People saying it's a fantastic laptop but giving it 2 stars, others saying it's a terrible laptop ",

Private OS makes money. I don't know if that's is supposed to be there. 2. After I create a Core/CPU. The stats appears to be chan",

But giving it two stars because of lack of optimization and a few bugs like two tracks playing simultaneously at the same time and not being able to choose some options in the design section even though they can be chosen or not being able",

No matter how much you research and unlock new things, it will still be random. It's really frustrating to pour lots of time into gathering research points only to get a 6 star review.",
